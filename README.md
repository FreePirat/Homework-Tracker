# Homework-Tracker
This project aims to make forgetting assignments a thing of the past. After inputing information on what the assignment is and setting a time for when it's needed, the program should be able to alert the user periodically. It should also give the user the ability to edit, delete and create new assignments. When an assignment meets its deadline, it will erase itself.
